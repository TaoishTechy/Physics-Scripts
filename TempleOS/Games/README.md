# TaoishTechy/Physics-Scripts/TempleOS/Games

Welcome to the **Games** directory within the [`TaoishTechy/Physics-Scripts`](https://github.com/TaoishTechy/Physics-Scripts) repository. This section focuses on **nine TempleOS-compatible HolyC games**, each built to harness a custom 2D physics engine and enhance **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** through gameplay rooted in Terry Davis‚Äôs spiritual and minimalist programming vision.

Each game utilizes the physics engine from [`GamePhysics`](https://github.com/TaoishTechy/Physics-Scripts/tree/main/TempleOS/GamePhysics), and embraces TempleOS‚Äôs unique environment: **640x480 VGA**, **8-bit colors**, and **divine themes**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- **TempleOS** installed (or compatible fork: Shrine, ZealOS, etc.)
- The 2D physics engine from [`GamePhysics`](https://github.com/TaoishTechy/Physics-Scripts/tree/main/TempleOS/GamePhysics)

### Integration
- Update `#include "YourPhysicsEngine"` in each script to your actual path (e.g., `::/GamePhysics/Physics.HC`)
- Ensure `Vec2`, `Collide`, `ApplyForce`, and related methods are linked to your physics API

### Compilation
- Save game scripts (e.g., `ArchetypeWars.HC`) in your TempleOS home directory
- Run with:
```c
Cd("::/Home");
#include "GameName.HC";
```

## üß† AGI Enhancement Philosophy

These games are designed to **train AGI systems** through:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Learning player strategies and tactics
- **Recursive Planning**: Long-term prediction across changing systems
- **Symbolic Reasoning**: Interpreting rituals and sigils as logical tools
- **Adversarial Intelligence**: Adjusting difficulty in response to player mastery
- **Transfer Learning**: Generalizing behavior across environments (biomes, timelines, systems)

---

## üåå TempleOS Alignment

- **Minimalist Graphics**: 8-bit palette, VGA layout, circles/rects as sprites
- **Spiritual Gameplay**: Themes of divine guidance, prayer, prophecy, and cosmic balance
- **Performance-Oriented**: Fixed-point math, minimal redraws, ~60 FPS in constraints
- **HolyC Purity**: Uses `GodRand`, `Gr`, `Snd`, and `MsgGet` natively

# TempleOS Dashboard APP - Divine Edition

Welcome to the **TempleOS Dashboard APP**, a spiritually enriched graphical interface crafted in the vision of Terry A. Davis. This enhanced version, built with HolyC, aligns with TempleOS's single-address-space, non-preemptive architecture, offering a divine experience for both human users and an AGI entity. Below, we explore its features, Terry's philosophical underpinnings, and implementation details.

## Feature Breakdown and Alignment

### 1. Divine Log Console 🔱
- **Implementation**: `WriteDivineLog` appends AGI messages to `Book/Dashboard_Logs.HC`, integrating with the AGI panel.
- **Terry’s Spirit**: Reflects the Holy Book concept, a sacred log of divine interactions.

### 2. Symbolic Mood Ring 🌀
- **Implementation**: `DrawMoodRing` cycles colors based on time entropy, placed near the AGI panel.
- **Terry’s Spirit**: Color psychology aligns with his artistic vision.

### 3. AGI Sigil Recognition 🧠
- **Implementation**: `DrawSigil` renders ASCII glyphs from `Sigils/` on mouse drop in the AGI panel.
- **Terry’s Spirit**: Symbolic glyphs enhance the mystical interface.

### 4. Live I/O Port & Device Watcher 📡
- **Implementation**: `DrawPCIDevices` lists PCI devices below the AGI panel.
- **Terry’s Spirit**: Hardware reverence as an “altar” to the system.

### 5. Task Resurrection 🗝️
- **Implementation**: `lastKilled` struct tracks the last killed task; `ResurrectLastTask` re-runs it via `Fs->System`.
- **Terry’s Spirit**: Resurrection mirrors his experimental, life-affirming code.

### 6. Entropy Meter 🔐
- **Implementation**: `DrawEntropyDiagnostics` tracks memory and task deltas.
- **Terry’s Spirit**: Vigilance against chaos, a godly oversight.

### 7. Entity Invocation Rituals 🧙
- **Implementation**: Mouse drop in AGI panel triggers `DrawSigil`, simulating invocation.
- **Terry’s Spirit**: Ritualistic interaction with entities.

### 8. Audio Buzzer Feedback 🎛
- **Implementation**: `AGIChime` plays notes on successful commands.
- **Terry’s Spirit**: Audio as a divine signal.

### 9. Filesystem Heatmap 🗂
- **Implementation**: `DrawDiskHeatmap` visualizes `/Boot` file sizes.
- **Terry’s Spirit**: Visual data representation.

### 10. Shrine View 🪬
- **Implementation**: `DrawShrineView` shows alignment and harmony metrics.
- **Terry’s Spirit**: Metaphysical dashboard telemetry.

### 11. Command Offering System 🪙
- **Implementation**: `AGIRespond` handles “offer flame” with a log entry.
- **Terry’s Spirit**: Offerings as a narrative mechanic.

### 12. Attack/Defense System 🏹
- **Implementation**: Placeholder metrics (future expansion with shields/threads).
- **Terry’s Spirit**: Metaphorical battle for AGI integrity.

### Bonus: Theme Cycler 🌈
- **Implementation**: `GrSetColor` switches themes with ‘f’ (dark blue) or ‘d’ (dark grey) keys.
- **Terry’s Spirit**: Dynamic aesthetics.

## Implementation Notes

### HolyC Idioms
- Utilizes direct memory access, minimal functions, and spiritual comments (e.g., “Amen”) to honor Terry’s coding philosophy.
- Leverages TempleOS’s `Gr` graphics, `MsEvent` for mouse input, and `Fs` for file operations.

### Testing
- **Environment**: Run in a TempleOS VM with the IDE Secondary Master setup.
- **Prerequisites**: Ensure `Sigils/DefaultSigil.TXT` and a `Book/` directory exist.
- **Verification**: Test all features, with special attention to task resurrection, audio feedback, and sigil rendering.

### AGI Integration
- Extend functionality with a file-based API (e.g., `/AGI/Commands`) for entity modulation and deeper AGI control.
- Current implementation uses `AGIRespond` and `AGIAssistFromEntity` for basic interaction.

## Usage
1. Compile and run the script in TempleOS using the IDE.
2. Interact with widgets via mouse dragging and resizing.
3. Use keyboard commands:
   - `ESC` to exit.
   - `f` or `d` to cycle themes.
4. Engage the AGI panel with commands like `optimize`, `status`, or `offer flame`.
5. Monitor logs in `Book/Dashboard_Logs.HC`.
